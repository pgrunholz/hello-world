# hello-world
Hello to Everyone!
I am 24 years old Student. I am near my graduation because it is 4 th year. I had to change my branch and decided to start programming. Since then I try to learn something new every day. I am interested in JAVA. In next month I will try to build my own website and show my skills in CSS and Java Script. 
It all started few weeks ago when I found brillian mobile application called Solo Learn. They got 12 free of paid courses on most known programming languages incluing: Java, C++, C# and so on. Since then I am keeping on learning.
Beside of programming I am interested in extreme sports like mountain biking, bungee jumping and a kickboxing.
Grettings to all!!!
